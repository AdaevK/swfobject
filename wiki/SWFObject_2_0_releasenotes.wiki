== SWFObject release notes ==

=== SWFObject v2.0 beta1 (October 1st, 2007) ===

  * We changed both the project's and library's name from SWFFix to SWFObject
  * For the static publishing method (option 1) the second argument (Flash player version string) is now required
  * To make the library less dependent on user agent string detection, we now detect Internet Explorer's and Opera's features by using proprietary feature testing (conditional compilation for Internet Explorer and `window.opera` and `window.opera.version` for Opera). The user's operating system is now determined based on a cascading approach, with the following priority: Internet Explorer condtional compilation, `navigator.platform` based detection, `navigator.useragent` based detection 
  * We added a `try`-`catch` block around the `document.write` statement (that inserts a deferred script to simulate a `DOMContentLoaded` event for Internet Explorer) to ensure it properly degrades to the `onload` event and to avoid an `Operation Aborted` error (which indicates that you try to access Internet Explorer's DOM, while it is locked and it is not ready for DOM manipulations yet)
  * We added a lot of feature tests to ensure that every feature is tested before it is called upon. This to improve the library's overall stability and future proofness
  * We fixed small flow bug in the `main()` function
  * We merged the `fixActiveContent()` and `fixIEActiveContent()` methods
  * We ran the library through the JSLint JavaScript verifier [ http://www.jslint.com/ ] and polished some code here and there to ensure the library's syntactical correctness

=== SWFFix v0.3 public alpha (August 20th, 2007) ===

  * The API got an overhaul to optimize the library's usability. It is more simplified and looks like:
    * SWFFix.registerObject(objectIdStr, swfVersionStr, xiSwfUrlStr); [ We removed the object notation. ]
    * SWFFix.embedSWF(swfUrlStr, replaceElemIdStr, widthStr, heightStr, swfVersionStr, xiSwfUrlStr, flashvarsObj, parObj, attObj); [ Is new and replaces the previous dynamic embed method. It now also supports express install and is closer to the SWFObject/UFO notation. ]
    * SWFFix.getFlashPlayerVersion();
    * SWFFix.hasFlashPlayerVersion(versionStr);
  * We compressed the library (with Dojo Shrinksafe: [ http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/shrinksafe/ ]) for file size optimization, and created a SRC directory that includes the uncompressed library (for means of development) and express install source files
  * We fixed an express install related bug and now check if a SWF's height is 137px (instead of the earlier 130px) or higher to avoid Download.Fail status calls to fire

=== SWFFix v0.2 public alpha (July 25th, 2007) ===

  * Initial release
