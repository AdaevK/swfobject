#summary SWFObject 2.2 development notes

== SWFObject 2.2 development notes ==

We have started with the development of SWFObject 2.2, which will address all items with the status `OnHold` or `FixedIn2.2AlphaX` in the SWFObject 2 Issues list [ http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/issues/list ].

You can preview or get the latest alpha releases (uncompressed library only) via the SWFObject 2 SVN repository [ http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/source/browse/trunk/swfobject/src/swfobject.js ]. Please note that these alpha releases are solely intended for testing and to give you a sneak peak of what is coming. They may still contain bugs or defects and should not be used for production purposes.

If you would like to discuss a new alpha release, please use the SWFObject discussion group [ http://groups.google.com/group/swfobject ].

If you find a new bug caused by newly developed code, please use the corresponding issue report on the SWFObject issues page [ http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/issues/list ].

You can test the latest SWFObject 2.2 alpha version with the SWFObject 2.2 test suite [ http://www.bobbyvandersluis.com/swfobject/testsuite_2_2/ ].
